# create-react-component

Bootstrap a dev environment for building a React component with TypeScript, ready for publishing with npm.

Currently builds components that are compatible with `react@17` and above.

```
$ npm install -g @maxpaj/create-react-component ts-node
```

```
$ create-react-component my-component --github-user github-username
```

## TODO

- Add some dev-server for developing in the browser
